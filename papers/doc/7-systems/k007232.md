# Konami K007232

a Konami's 2 channel PCM sound chip was used in their arcade boards in 1986-1990.

Its sample format is unique; the topmost bit is the end marker, and the low 7 bits are used for generating sound (unsigned format).

It has 7 bit digital output per each channel and no volume register on chip, so it needs external logic to control channel volume.
