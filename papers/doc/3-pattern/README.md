# patterns

a pattern consists of columns ("channels") and rows.
each column has several subcolumns in this order:

1. note
2. instrument
3. volume
4. effect and effect value (several)

clicking on the top left corner of the pattern view allows you to increase or decrease the number of effect columns a channel has (max 4 per channel).

all columns are represented in hexadecimal, except for the note column.

for a list of effects [click here](effects.md).
