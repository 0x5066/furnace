# to-do for 0.6

- **auto-backup. please.**
- non-monospaced fonts in pattern editor
- panning macro
- pitch macro
- sample editor
  - keybinds
  - don't allow editing samples that aren't 8/16-bit
  - maybe an hex editor
- piano/input pad
- MIDI input
- all the systems
- Also confused as to why after playing a row with Ctrl-Enter, you are locked out of moving the cursor outside of +/- 1 position and THEN typing something places it under the actual cursor, and not the ghost cursor. it seems like just a way to get "please can we play rows" people to be quiet because it's otherwise effectively useless
- edit latch! and maybe separate edit masks
